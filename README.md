This is not to be taken seriously.
I am learning how github functions, and any content contained within this repository is merely the result of me... "Fucking Around," so-to-speak.
If you really wish to use anything in here, you have full permission to do so. If anything, it would truly honor me that anybody would find this repo in such a high regard that they would actually think they can learn anything from it.
